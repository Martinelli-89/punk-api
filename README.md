<h1>Punk API </h1>

As a challenge to test our understandment of React  during the _Nology course we were asked to build a React app that used the Punk API(<a href=https://punkapi.com/>link</a>) . This were the specificications for the project:
<ul>
    <li>Buil entirely in React;</li>
    <li>Public repository on github;</li>
    <li>use the Punk API;</li>
    <li>test where possible (RTL);</li>
    <li>code formatted correctly;</li>
    <li>build with a mobile first approach;</li>
</ul>

    <li>Technologies</li>
    <li>Setup</li>
    <li>Status</li>
    <li>Future development</li>
</ul>

<h2>General Info</h2>
<p>Using the different query available in the Punk API documentation the user can request to see different beers. The app provides then the possibility to filter them according to a low PH or to do a manual search by name. </p>

<h2>Technologies</h2>
<p>The game was built with:</p>
<ul>
    <li>React</li>
    <li>CSS / SASS</li>
</ul>

<h2>Setup</h2>
<p>Just access the game on Netlify <a href="https://dainty-belekoy-a6cbcb.netlify.app/">Punk API</a> and have a look around.</p>

<h2>Status<h2>
<p>The app works. I only need to implement different error handling for the fetch request errors. At the moment client side bad request or server error are treated in the same way and display the same error message. </p> 


<h5>Thanks for checking the app. If you find any bug I didn't notice or have any suggestion please reach out :)<h5>
